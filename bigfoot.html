      <h1>SOME DOPE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BIGFOOT</h1>
      <p>
        Bigfoot is an ape-human type creature that many believe lives mostly in forests in the Pacific Northwest region of the North American continent. He is also often referred to as Sasquatch. He is often described as a large and hairy, resembling a half-man, half-ape creature in folklore and myths. Many of those who have reported seeing Bigfoot describe him with large eyes, a low-set forehead, large brow-ridge, and having enormous footprints. He is believed to be upwards of 500 pounds and anywhere from two to three meters tall. He is also reported to be rather smelly, and he is mainly nocturnal.
